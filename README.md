> This is a web-based application that I developed in my spare time and is now used by the Development team for the Timpson Group for estimating devops work items story points, it consists of a host that starts the game and other players can scan the a QR code to join, once in it uses web sockets for instant client to host communication.
> 
> Players can then vote on how long they think the devops item will take, at which time the host can reveal votes, discuss and revote.
>
> It's free to use and adjust for yourself, I just ask that you don't fork and try to pass the application off as your own.
